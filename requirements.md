- Implement robust ETL processes to cleanse, normalize, and enrich data to support reporting and analytics.
- Develop APIs and connectors to enable seamless integration with third-party systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms, logistics providers).

### 1.3. API Contracts and Service Interfaces
- Define a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs to expose core ERP functionalities to client applications and external systems.
- Ensure API contracts are well-documented, versioned, and adhere to industry best practices (e.g., OpenAPI specification).
- Implement API gateways and/or service mesh to manage cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and monitoring.

### 1.4. Authentication and Authorization Requirements
- Implement a centralized identity and access management solution to handle user authentication, role-based access control, and single sign-on.
- Leverage modern auth protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to secure API access and protect sensitive data.
- Establish granular permissions model to control access to specific ERP modules, features, and data sets based on user roles and organizational hierarchies.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Performance Benchmarks and Scalability Targets
- Ensure the system can handle peak workloads of up to 50,000 concurrent users and process 1 million transactions per day.
- Achieve sub-second response times for core ERP operations (e.g., order placement, inventory lookup, invoice generation).
- Implement caching, data partitioning, and other optimization techniques to maintain high performance at scale.

### 2.2. Database Design and Data Access Patterns
- Utilize a hybrid data storage architecture, combining a relational database (e.g., Azure SQL Database) for structured data and a NoSQL database (e.g., Cosmos DB) for unstructured data and event sourcing.
- Optimize data access patterns to minimize expensive joins and cross-cutting queries, leveraging techniques like materialized views and denormalization.
- Implement a data access layer that abstracts the underlying data storage technologies and provides a consistent, domain-driven API for application components.

### 2.3. Caching Strategies and Optimization Requirements
- Employ a distributed caching solution (e.g., Redis, Azure Cache for Redis) to store frequently accessed data, such as product catalogs, customer profiles, and pricing information.
- Implement smart cache invalidation policies to ensure data freshness and consistency, considering factors like time-to-live (TTL) and cache-aside patterns.
- Leverage techniques like query caching, in-memory data grids, and client-side caching to further improve response times and reduce load on the primary data stores.

### 2.4. Monitoring, Logging, and Observability Requirements
- Implement a centralized logging and monitoring solution (e.g., Azure Monitor, Elastic Stack) to collect, store, and analyze application logs, infrastructure metrics, and user activity data.
- Establish clear logging standards and practices, including structured logging, contextual information, and error handling.
- Integrate with distributed tracing solutions (e.g., Azure Application Insights, Jaeger) to enable end-to-end visibility into system performance and troubleshooting.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1. .NET Version and Framework Requirements
- Target .NET 6 or the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of the .NET framework to leverage the latest language features, performance improvements, and security enhancements.
- Utilize the ASP.NET Core framework for building web-based APIs and service components, taking advantage of its modular design, dependency injection, and cross-platform support.

### 3.2. Microservices vs. Monolithic Considerations
- Adopt a microservices-based architecture to promote scalability, flexibility, and independent deployments of individual ERP modules.
- Design service boundaries aligned with the core ERP subdomains (e.g., Customers, Inventory, Orders, Accounting) to enable autonomous teams and technology stacks.
- Implement API gateways, service discovery, and distributed communication patterns (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous) to manage the complexity of a microservices landscape.

### 3.3. Database Technology Selection Criteria
- Utilize Azure SQL Database as the primary relational data store, taking advantage of its scalability, high availability, and built-in security and compliance features.
- Implement Cosmos DB as the NoSQL data store for handling unstructured data, event sourcing, and other scenarios requiring flexible schema and horizontal scaling.
- Evaluate the use of Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure Data Lake Storage for large-scale data warehousing and analytical workloads.

### 3.4. Message Queuing and Async Processing Needs
- Leverage Azure Service Bus or Azure Event Grid to decouple service dependencies and enable asynchronous, event-driven communication between microservices.
- Implement reliable message queuing and pub/sub patterns to handle long-running tasks, background processing, and event sourcing.
- Ensure message delivery guarantees, retries, and dead-letter queues to maintain data integrity and handle failure scenarios.

### 3.5. Docker Containerization Requirements
- Package all backend services and supporting components (e.g., databases, caching, message queues) as Docker containers to enable consistent, repeatable deployments.
- Utilize container orchestration platforms like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Container Instances to manage the deployment, scaling, and health of containerized applications.
- Implement container-based CI/CD pipelines to streamline the build, test, and release processes for the ERP system.

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1. C# Coding Standards and Best Practices
- Adhere to the official .NET Core C# Coding Conventions and the C# Programming Guide to ensure consistent, maintainable code.
- Leverage modern C# language features, such as async/await, LINQ, and record types, to write concise, expressive, and performant code.
- Implement design patterns and architectural principles (e.g., SOLID, DDD, CQRS) to promote modularity, testability, and scalability.

### 4.2. Error Handling and Logging Patterns
- Establish a centralized, structured logging approach using a framework like Serilog or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.
- Implement consistent error handling and exception management techniques, including custom exception types, global error handling, and detailed logging of errors and exceptions.
- Ensure logs provide enough contextual information (e.g., user details, request metadata, execution state) to enable effective monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting.

### 4.3. Unit Testing and Integration Testing Requirements
- Develop comprehensive unit tests covering the core business logic, API contracts, and infrastructure components to ensure code correctness and maintainability.
- Implement integration tests to validate end-to-end system behavior, including data access, message handling, and cross-service interactions.
- Integrate test automation into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce test coverage thresholds and maintain quality gates.

### 4.4. CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- Establish a robust, end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or a similar toolchain.
- Implement automated build, test, and deployment stages to ensure consistent, reliable, and frequent releases of the ERP system.
